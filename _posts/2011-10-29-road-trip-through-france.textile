title: My road-trip through France - The video
---

Late April 2011 me and my friends had this wicked idea to get in the car and visit as much places as possible within just three days. We captured the following video. I'm the nerdy looking guy with the awesome sunglasses holding the photo camera.

We visited Château de Versailles, Cathédrale de Chartres, Mont Saint-Michel and Château de Chambord. We also stopped for a full day in Paris on our way back. This almost covered 2000 kilometers and 20 hours of driving-time. Best weekend ever.
