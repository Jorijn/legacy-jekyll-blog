title: "Creating my resume with modern web technologies"
---

Sometimes when you're caught up in work you'll still need to tickle your skills a bit - keep up to date, if I may say so. It doesn't hurt trying out new things and publishing what you made to show others what you're up to.

I recently decided it would be a fun project to grab my resume, made with Pages and then exported to PDF and "convert" (sort of speak) it to a web page. I wanted to learn and try out a bunch of new technologies so here's what I wanted to use:

* Responsive Grid, namely Susy for Compass
* Compass
* SASS
* Webkit Retina graphics
* @font-face

View the GitHub project here: "https://github.com/Jorijn/CV":https://github.com/Jorijn/CV
View my resume here: "http://jorijn.github.io/CV/":http://jorijn.github.io/CV/

Since it's responsive, try resizing your browsers or viewing it on a phone or tablet! :-)
