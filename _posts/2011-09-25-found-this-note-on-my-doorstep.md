Dear Human,

Over the past several weeks we mutually agreed on the feeding schedule stating dry food at 8AM and my portion of meat at 7PM. It is currently 9PM and you are nowhere to be found. Although it is clear who the financially responsible one is - I do have rights. I expect my dinner on time as you expect me to not feed on your so called "other pets".

In addition to this very clear request, I'd like you to stop treating me like I'm some sort of a child. Don't "Awww, are you hungry?" me when you show up four hours too late. I expect to be treated equally, to be scratched behind my ears once a day and have my toilet cleaned at least twice a day. I'll kindly return the favor by nail-massaging your legs. 

If you could bring up the discipline to abide to this rules, I might refrain from using your big white scratching post you dearly like, called "furniture".

Sincerely,
Your cat.
