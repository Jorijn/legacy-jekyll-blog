title: "I'm upgrading my coffee habits"
---

For a fairly long time my morning would consist of waking up, grabbing coffee. When I arrived at my job I'd just continue drinking coffee - every half hour. Just a few weeks ago I permanently moved to a new apartment and saying my parents goodbye. Since I am - or was - an extreme coffee drinker I figured I would need a proper machine for creating my cup of morning brew.

I acquired a [Magimix M100](http://www.magimix-spares.co.uk/Magimix-M100-Eco-coffee-maker-Automatic-Smooth-silver-11279/product/11279/11279/) nespresso device. My judgement was direct and simple: Best home made coffee I ever tasted. The downside: I'm stuck on nespresso cups that cost â‚¬ 0,36 a piece. This doesn't really matter since I downgraded my coffee habits to just one cup a day.

Now, at work we have your average day coffee machine. It creates your cappuccino from a mixture of fabricated milk and sirup based coffee extract. It doesn't really taste like coffee but it sure beats water.  The problem was, as soon as I started drinking the nespresso coffee the milky sirup coffee started tasting like shit.

I replaced the average 4 - 6 cups of coffee a day at work by a few cups of tea thus eliminating all this unhealthy coffee full of useless calories. I'd say this is worth the phrase upgrade.
