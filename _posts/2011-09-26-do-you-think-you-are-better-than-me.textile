title: "Do you think you're better than me?"
---

I create the most awesome IT solutions within only a few hours. I bring along the karma that makes computers fix themselves by just being around. However, I do feel that this isn't my true game. 

A week ago I resigned my position as Rhinofly's system administrator and just today I'm publicly announcing it. I know for a fact that there are dozens of really good and qualified people out there just waiting to be me. Rhinofly pays you well and offers an unique culture of people who care about you and your work. 

Do you know anybody - perhaps yourself - that wants a new and challenging job near Utrecht, The Netherlands? Check out "their new opening":http://rhinofly.nl/vacatures/vacatures/rhinofly-zoekt-een-system-administrator/index.cfm?articles_id=BCD202D1-8E04-47A8-95E0-8754387C76A5.
