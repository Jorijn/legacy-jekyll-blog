title: "If This Then That"

I'm not going to write extensively about _ifttt_, but I would like to share its awesomeness. [If This Then That](http://ifttt.com/) (ifttt) hooks a lot of the current social websites together to an event-based system.

To show you how much of a nerd I am -- I just created a task which e-mails me to get going a bit more earlier to my car as usual because the temperature dropped below freezing point that night.

Fortunately it is also possible to use ifttt for the good. Here are the current tasks I have created:

* Whenever Smashing Magazine publishes an article to their RSS feeds, it gets stored in a notebook in Evernote
* All tweets from my Twitter account are stored in a notebook named "Twitter" in Evernote and tagged accordingly with the author and type of the tweet
* When someone tags me in a new photo on Facebook, ifttt uploads it to a folder in my Dropbox
* When I upload a new picture to my Facebook wall, ifttt also uploads it to a folder in my Dropbox
* All attachments from my Google Mail account are uploaded to a folder in my Dropbox
* When a new tweet originating from me contains the hashtag #fb, ifttt publishes the story to my Facebook
* When I change my Facebook profile picture, ifttt changes the one for me on Twitter

Services like this make me really like the internet. If anyone can come up with even more awesome combinations, let me know.
